# Content type

The ParcelValue API uses the `JSON API` content type.

> JSON API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests.  
> JSON API requires use of the JSON API media type (`application/vnd.api+json`) for exchanging data.

Any call to the API needs to send the proper `Accept` header.

Please see https://jsonapi.org for more information.
